    <h1>PEAK TO TROUGH</h1>
    <p>Rising peaks and troughs can be seen easily on a chart by recognizing the higher peaks, or tops, and higher troughs, or bottoms, creating the uptrend. Another way to look at it would be to recognize that each new peak created by action is higher than the high of the previous few days, weeks or even months of movement. As well, each new trough would also be higher than the previous trough over the same period of time.</p>
